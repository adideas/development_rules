> Git-flow is an alternative Git branching model that uses feature branches and multiple master branches.

```
> git flow init

No branches exist yet. Base branches must be created now.

Branch name for production releases: [master]
ranch name for "next release" development: [develop]

How to name your supporting branch prefixes?

Feature branches? [feature/]
Release branches? [release/]
Hotfix branches? [hotfix/]
Support branches? [support/]

Version tag prefix? [] > YOU_NAME/
```
